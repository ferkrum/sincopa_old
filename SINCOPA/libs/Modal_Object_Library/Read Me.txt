The Modal Object Library
by Vincent Joseph Manzo


The Modal Object Library is a collection of objects for Pure Data that control modality created by V.J. Manzo.

This library is a port of the original Modal Object Library created by V.J. Manzo in 2006. 

To install, copy this folder into the Pure Data file path. For added support copy the file, "Modal_Object_Library.pd" into the folder "...pd\doc". Then select Modal_Object_Library from "Browser" help menu [ctrl-b] when Pd is running.
