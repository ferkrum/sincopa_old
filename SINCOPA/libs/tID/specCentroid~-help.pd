#X text 372 27 Spectral Centroid is the center of mass of magnitude
spectrum \, and is a common low-level timbre feature. It is computed
as the ratio of the sum of spectral magnitude weighted by frequency
to the sum of spectral magnitude. Therefore \, it reports the frequency
associated with spectral center of mass. This is clearly demonstrated
at left \, where two perfect spikes in the spectrum at 400 Hz and 500
Hz produce a centroid near 450 Hz. \; \; This feature can be sent to
the timbreID external in order to identify percussive timbres in real
time. \; \; Audio buffering and Hann windowing are taken care of by
the external \, so there is no need for tabreceive~ or block~. You
can set the window size with a creation argument \, or change it with
the "window" message.;
