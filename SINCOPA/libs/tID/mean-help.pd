#X text 37 120 Suppose you take 32 spectral centroid measurements over
the course of a 2 second sound \, and 16 centroid measurements over
the course of a 1 second sound. A distance between these two feature
vectors cannot be calculated because they have a different number of
components.;
#X text 37 290 Creating a larger feature vector composed of several
time-varying timbre features summarized in this fashion will pack a
great deal of information into one compact descriptor. In other words
\, you can create a vector that describes how spectral centroid \,
flatness \, flux \, and individual Bark-frequency cepstral coefficients
vary over the course of a sound.;
#X text 531 350 Also see:;
#X text 37 200 Taking the mean and standard deviation for each of these
centroid lists creates two 2-component lists that CAN be compared to
compute a distance. All the precise detail of how centroid varied over
the course of each sound is lost \, but mean and standard deviation
do provide meaningful general information about a data set.;

#X text 37 30 [mean] calculates the arithmetic mean (average) of a
list of numbers. The list must have at least 1 element. It is intended
to be used for summarizing time-varying timbre attributes that are
measured with other timbreID externals. This provides one way to compare
the spectro-temporal characteristics of sounds with different durations.

#X text 491 52 If you're using Pd-extended \, typing "mean" into an
object box will bring up a mean external from the cyclone library.
It functions slightly differently \, so be sure you're invoking the
correct one. You could be sure of this by always invoking the timbreID
mean like this:;
